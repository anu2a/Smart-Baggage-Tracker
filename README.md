# SMART BAGGAGE TRACKER
Smart Baggage is an IoT application attached to a suitcase. It has two main parts of functionalities which can help users to manage their personal trips and let their luggages automatically follow them in the airport. In the first part, the trip managing part is implemented on an Andorid application, and developed it by android studio. The users can add journeys, set traveling time and manage items which are planned to take. When users are packaging their luggages, they can use camera to capture the items which they have put in the suitcase. If something important is left after finishing packing, the app will notify the user to take it. In the second part, we use a robot car and a motion detection procedure to drive the suitcase. In the application, when the user push the auto-driving button, the robot will use a camera to keep tracing the target item and follow it. Users can also drive the suitcase by their own via several controlling button. Besides, we also provide some data analysis. We make a collection of map markers to show all the place where the user has visited in. The markers shows the exact destination and date as well. A geo-map also shows the visiting frequency of different countries.
## Architecture
The connections between all the three parts is as below:
